This is a full-stack project.Upload any csv file into the system 
- Display a list of all uploaded csv files
- When the user selects a file, display all the data (with column headers) in a table on the page (front
end)
- There is a search box which searches on the front end itself and displays the matching rows
of the table only (empty search box displays all the data). (you can put a search on any one column)
- DIFFERENT CSV FILES WITH DIFFERENT COLUMN HEADERS CAN BE UPLOADED.
- In this project for frontend I used HTML,CSS,Javascript and server side I used Node.js and Mongodb as database
